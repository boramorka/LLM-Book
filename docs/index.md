# Overview

## About me

Hello, my name is Nikita Goryachev, and I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer at Sber. My team implementing SOTA algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recommender Systems (RecSys). We also organizing industry meetups, participating in prestigious conferences like the RecSys conference in Singapore and AI Journey in Moscow, and contributing to the development of RePlay, an expansive open-source library for recommender systems.

## About This Book

I have authored a guide that serves as an essential resource for Data Scientists, ML Engineers, Software Developers, and other professionals who find themselves navigating the complex landscape of modern artificial intelligence technologies. This book is crafted to demystify the complexities inherent in AI applications, with a focused lens on Large Language Models (LLMs), conversational AI, and the nuanced process of integrating LLMs into development workflows, particularly emphasizing the tailored application of Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops) for these models. My goal is to equip readers with the knowledge and tools needed to harness the potential of AI technologies, guiding them through the intricacies of this rapidly evolving field with clarity and insight.

The methodologies and insights provided in this book extend beyond theoretical understanding, illustrating how LLMs can be seamlessly integrated into various business scenarios. From enhancing customer service with conversational chatbots to personalizing user experiences through recommender systems, and optimizing operational efficiencies with ML Ops, the application of LLMs across different facets of a business is both broad and impactful. This guide emphasizes the fundamental application skills required to implement LLMs in any business process, highlighting the versatility and transformative potential of these models in driving innovation, improving decision-making, and creating value. By bridging the gap between complex AI technologies and practical business applications, this book equips professionals with the knowledge to not only navigate the landscape of artificial intelligence but to also leverage it as a powerful tool for business growth and innovation.
