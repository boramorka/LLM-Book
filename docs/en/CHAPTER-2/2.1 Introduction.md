# 2.1 Introduction

LangChain is an open framework that connects large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to a user’s internal and personal data, enabling you to “talk” to documents and get answers from content that search engines can’t see or that was created after a model was trained. Created by Harrison Chase (co‑founder and CEO of LangChain), it is a key step toward letting organizations and individuals genuinely use their own data. The core idea is to democratize access to information and turn “raw” data into an interactive, dialog‑driven knowledge source: internal reports, research, personal notes — you can now ask about them like you would an assistant, without SQL queries or manual file search, speeding up analysis and making data work far more efficient.

LangChain’s architecture is modular and built to assemble and deploy LLM applications. At its heart are prompts that set instructions and context for relevant generation; models, i.e. the LLMs that understand context and produce human‑like answers; indexes that speed up indexing and retrieval; chains — multi‑step processing pipelines where you can clean, analyze, and compose final answers; and agents — “orchestrators” that combine tools, manage data flow, and adapt behavior to specific tasks. Together these elements form a flexible platform that can be tailored to almost any data landscape and use case.

Functionally, LangChain covers the full data lifecycle around LLMs. It supports loading documents from many sources and formats with configurable access and keys; offers pre‑processing — splitting texts into semantically meaningful chunks that preserve context and improve retrieval; implements semantic search via embeddings and similarity measures so that you interact with data by meaning rather than keywords; and, for conversational scenarios, provides “memory” — keeping track of prior messages and maintaining a coherent dialogue — which integrates naturally into chains. This combination makes LangChain a great fit for assistants, analytical tools, and enterprise bots running on private knowledge stores.

To go deeper, start with the official docs and tutorials, lean on the community, and take a basic LangChain LLM‑app course — you’ll get a fast practical ramp‑up and learn to build solutions that put your internal data to work alongside LLMs.
