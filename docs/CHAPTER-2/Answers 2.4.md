## Theory
1. The primary purpose of converting textual information into embeddings is to transform text into numerical vectors in a way that captures semantic meaning, enabling computers to process and understand textual data more effectively.
2. Embeddings capture semantic similarity by positioning words or sentences with similar meanings closer to each other in a high-dimensional vector space, facilitating tasks like semantic search.
3. The process of creating word embeddings involves training models on large text corpora to learn vector representations of words based on their context, ensuring that words used in similar contexts have similar vector representations.
4. In semantic search, embeddings allow the system to understand the intent and contextual meaning behind queries, enabling it to retrieve documents that are semantically related to the query, even without exact keyword matches.
5. Document embeddings represent the semantic essence of entire documents, while query embeddings represent the semantic intent of search queries. Comparing these embeddings enables the identification of documents that are semantically relevant to the query.
6. A vector store is a database optimized for storing and retrieving high-dimensional vector data (embeddings), crucial for performing efficient similarity searches in applications like semantic search.
7. When choosing a vector store, considerations include the size of the dataset, persistence requirements, and the specific use case, such as whether the application is for research, development, or production use.
8. Chroma is suitable for rapid prototyping and small datasets due to its in-memory nature, which allows for fast data retrieval. Its limitations include lack of persistence and scalability for larger datasets.
9. The workflow involves document splitting, embedding generation, vector store indexing, query processing, and response generation, collectively enabling efficient semantic search capabilities.
10. Document splitting improves search granularity and relevance by breaking down documents into semantically coherent chunks, allowing for more precise matching of document parts to queries.
11. Embedding generation for document chunks involves mapping text to high-dimensional vectors, capturing the semantic features of the text and enabling efficient computational processing and comparison.
12. Vector store indexing allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings, enabling quick similarity searches to find document chunks most relevant to a given query.
13. Query processing involves generating an embedding for the user's query and searching the vector store for document embeddings that are most similar, using metrics like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
14. Response generation enhances user experience by using retrieved document chunks and the original query to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, leveraging large language models.
15. Setting up the environment involves importing necessary libraries, setting up API keys, and configuring the system to ensure it is properly prepared for embedding and vector store operations.
16. Document loading and splitting are crucial for managing textual data more effectively, breaking it down into smaller, manageable, and semantically meaningful chunks for better processing.
17. Generating embeddings transforms textual information into numerical vectors that encapsulate semantic meanings, with similarity demonstrated through metrics like the dot product between vectors.
18. When setting up Chroma, considerations include the directory for persistence, clearing existing data for a fresh start, and initializing the store with document splits and embeddings for retrieval.
19. Similarity searches facilitate the retrieval of relevant document chunks by comparing the query embedding with document embeddings to find the closest matches based on semantic similarity.
20. Potential failure modes in semantic searches include duplicate entries and irrelevant document inclusion. Addressing these involves refining the search process to ensure relevance and distinctiveness of results.
