# 2.4 The Power of Embeddings

### What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings are a technique used to convert textual information into numerical form. This transformation is essential because, unlike humans, computers are more adept at handling numbers than text. The process involves mapping words, sentences, or entire documents to vectors of real numbers in a high-dimensional space. The main goal of embeddings is to encapsulate the semantic meaning of the text, such that words or sentences with similar meanings are located closer to each other in this vector space. 

#### Detailed Process of Creating Embeddings

Creating embeddings involves several steps and methodologies, with one of the most common being the training of models on large text corpora. During this training, the model learns to associate words with their contexts, capturing nuanced semantic relationships. For instance, in word embeddings, each word is assigned a specific vector in the vector space. The positioning of these vectors is not random; it is determined based on the usage and context of the words within a large dataset. This means that synonyms or words used in similar contexts end up being positioned near each other. 

#### Application of Embeddings in Semantic Search

Semantic search represents an advanced type of search that goes beyond matching keywords to understand the intent and contextual meaning behind a query. Embeddings are at the heart of this technology, enabling systems to grasp the semantic nuances of both the search queries and the content within the documents they search through. 

Here's a step-by-step overview of how embeddings are used in semantic search:

1. **Preparation of Document Embeddings:** Initially, each document in the search corpus is processed to generate its embedding. This step is crucial for encapsulating the semantic essence of each document into a numerical vector.

2. **Query Embedding Generation:** When a search query is received, it is also transformed into an embedding. This process ensures that the query can be compared directly with the document embeddings in the corpus.

3. **Similarity Comparison:** With both the documents and the query converted into embeddings, the next step involves computing the similarity between the query vector and each document vector. This comparison typically involves calculating the distance (such as Euclidean distance) or similarity (such as cosine similarity) between vectors. Documents whose embeddings are closer to the query embedding are considered more relevant to the search query.

4. **Retrieval of Relevant Documents:** Based on the similarity scores, documents are ranked, and the most relevant ones are retrieved as search results. This method allows for the identification of documents that are semantically related to the query, even if they do not share exact keyword matches.

In summary, embeddings transform the way textual content is analyzed, stored, and retrieved, enabling more sophisticated and semantically rich interactions between users and information systems. By capturing the deeper meaning of text, embeddings facilitate a range of applications, from enhancing search engines to powering recommendation systems and beyond.

## Vector Stores: Efficient Retrieval of Similar Vectors

A vector store is a type of database optimized for the storage, management, and retrieval of vector data. Vector data, in this context, refers to the numerical vectors that represent embeddings of text, images, or any other data type converted into a numerical form for processing by machine learning models. The primary functionality of a vector store is to facilitate similarity searches. This means it can quickly identify and retrieve vectors in the database that are closest to a given query vector, according to certain distance metrics like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

#### Key Features and Operations

Vector stores are engineered to perform high-speed similarity searches across large volumes of vector data. They achieve this through various optimization techniques such as indexing, which allows for efficient query processing by reducing the number of vectors that need to be compared directly with the query vector. These stores support operations that are crucial for applications like recommendation systems, where finding items similar to a user's interests is essential, or in natural language processing tasks, where finding documents with content similar to a query can enhance information retrieval and text analysis processes.

#### Criteria for Choosing a Vector Store

When selecting a vector store for a project, several considerations come into play:

1. **Dataset Size:** The volume of data you expect to store and query impacts the choice of vector store. Some vector stores are designed to handle large, distributed datasets efficiently, while others may be optimized for smaller, in-memory datasets.

2. **Persistence Requirement:** Depending on whether the data needs to be durable (persisted across sessions) or can be ephemeral (temporary and in-memory), different vector stores offer varying capabilities. Persistent storage is crucial for applications where data is continuously accumulated and needs to be reliably stored for long-term retrieval. In contrast, in-memory storage may suffice for temporary datasets or rapid prototyping environments.

3. **Specific Use Case:** The nature of the application—whether it's for research, development, or production use—also influences the choice. Some vector stores are designed with specific features to support complex queries and analytics, making them suitable for research and development. Others prioritize scalability and robustness for production environments.

### Example: Chroma for Rapid Prototyping and Small Datasets

Chroma is highlighted as an example of a vector store that is particularly well-suited for rapid prototyping and applications dealing with small datasets. Its in-memory nature means that it stores data directly in RAM, allowing for fast data retrieval and high throughput at the cost of persistence and scalability. This makes Chroma an excellent choice for experimental projects or applications where the dataset size is manageable and data persistence beyond the application session is not critical.

Other vector stores might offer features like distributed storage, cloud-based services, and enhanced persistence mechanisms, catering to applications that require scalability and the ability to handle growing data volumes over time. These systems may be preferred for production-grade applications where data reliability, availability, and scalability are paramount.

In conclusion, the selection of a vector store is a critical decision that impacts the efficiency and scalability of applications involving similarity searches and vector data retrieval. By carefully considering the dataset size, persistence requirements, and specific use case requirements, developers can choose the most appropriate vector store to meet their application's needs.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow for implementing embeddings and vector stores in semantic search comprises the following steps:
#### 1. Document Splitting

The initial step involves breaking down the corpus of original documents into smaller, more manageable pieces that are semantically coherent. This process, known as document splitting, is crucial for improving the granularity of the search results. Each chunk or segment should ideally represent a single topic or concept to ensure that the embeddings generated in the subsequent step accurately capture the semantic essence of the text. This step enhances the system's ability to match specific parts of documents to queries, rather than retrieving entire documents that may only be partially relevant.

#### 2. Embedding Generation

Once the documents are split into semantically coherent chunks, the next step is to convert these chunks into embeddings. Embedding generation involves using machine learning models to map the text into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors represent the semantic features of the text, such that text chunks with similar meanings are represented by vectors that are close to each other in the vector space. This step is fundamental in transforming textual information into a format that can be efficiently processed and compared by computational systems.

#### 3. Vector Store Indexing

After generating embeddings for each document chunk, these embeddings are then stored in a vector store. The vector store is a specialized database designed for the efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vector data. By indexing the embeddings in a vector store, the system can quickly perform similarity searches to find vectors that are most similar to a given query vector. This capability is key to enabling fast and accurate retrieval of document chunks that are relevant to a user's search query.

#### 4. Query Processing

When a user submits a query, the system generates an embedding for the query using the same process as for the document chunks. This query embedding is then used to search the vector store for the embeddings that are most similar to it. The similarity search can be based on various distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, to identify the document chunks whose embeddings have the shortest distance or highest similarity to the query embedding. This step ensures that the search results are semantically related to the query, improving the relevance of the retrieved information.

#### 5. Response Generation

The final step involves passing the retrieved document chunks to a large language model (LLM) along with the original query. The LLM uses the information from the document chunks and the query to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response. This process leverages the LLM's ability to understand and generate natural language, providing users with answers that are not only relevant but also formulated in a way that is easy to understand. This step is crucial for enhancing the user experience by delivering precise and informative answers based on the semantically relevant document chunks retrieved from the vector store.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into the complexities of embeddings and vector stores, it's essential to prepare the development environment. This involves importing necessary libraries, setting up API keys, and ensuring that the system is configured correctly.

```python
import os
import openai
import sys
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

# Extend the system path to include the project directory
sys.path.append('../..')

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

# Configure the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```

## Document Loading and Splitting

The initial stage in the workflow involves loading documents and splitting them into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks. This step is crucial for managing the data more effectively and preparing it for embedding.

### Loading Documents

For demonstration purposes, a series of PDF documents from a lecture series are loaded. This includes intentionally duplicating one document to simulate a scenario with messy data.

```python
# Import the PyPDFLoader class from the langchain library
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

# Initialize a list of PDF loaders, each representing a specific lecture document
pdf_document_loaders = [
    PyPDFLoader("docs/doc1.pdf"),
    PyPDFLoader("docs/doc2.pdf"),
    PyPDFLoader("docs/doc3.pdf"),
]

# Create an empty list to store the content of each loaded document
loaded_documents_content = []

# Iterate through each PDF loader in the list to load documents
for document_loader in pdf_document_loaders:
    # Use the load method of each PyPDFLoader instance to load the document's content
    # and extend the loaded_documents_content list with the result
    loaded_documents_content.extend(document_loader.load())

# At this point, loaded_documents_content contains the content of all specified PDFs

```

### Splitting Documents

After loading, documents are split into smaller chunks to enhance the manageability and efficiency of the subsequent processes.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Configure and apply the text splitter
document_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1500,
    chunk_overlap=150
)
document_splits = document_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

## Generating Embeddings

Embeddings are created for each document chunk, transforming the textual information into numerical vectors that capture the semantic essence of the text.

```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
import numpy as np

embedding_generator = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Example sentences for embedding
sentence_examples = ["I like dogs", "I like canines", "The weather is ugly outside"]

# Generate embeddings for each sentence
embeddings = [embedding_generator.embed_query(sentence) for sentence in sentence_examples]

# Demonstrating similarity through dot product
similarity_dog_canine = np.dot(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
similarity_dog_weather = np.dot(embeddings[0], embeddings[2])
```

## Vector Stores for Efficient Retrieval

With embeddings generated, the next step involves indexing these vectors in a vector store to facilitate efficient similarity searches.

### Setting Up Chroma as the Vector Store

Chroma is selected for its lightweight and in-memory characteristics, suitable for demonstration purposes.

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

# Define the directory for persisting the vector store
persist_directory = 'docs/chroma/'

# Clear any existing data in the persist directory
!rm -rf ./docs/chroma

# Initialize and populate the vector store with document splits and their embeddings
vector_database = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=document_splits,
    embedding=embedding_generator,
    persist_directory=persist_directory
)
```

## Conducting Similarity Searches

The primary utility of embeddings and vector stores is demonstrated through similarity searches, which allow for the retrieval of document chunks most relevant to a given query.

```python
# Example query
query = "Is there an email I can ask for help?"

# Retrieve the top 3 most similar document chunks
retrieved_documents = vector_database.similarity_search(query, k=3)

# Inspect the content of the top result
print(retrieved_documents[0].page_content)
```

## Addressing Failure Modes and Enhancing Search

While basic similarity searches are effective, certain edge cases and failure modes necessitate further refinement.

### Identifying and Addressing Failure Modes

Duplicate entries and the inclusion of irrelevant documents from other lectures are common issues that can undermine the effectiveness of semantic searches.

```python
# Example failure mode query
query_matlab = "What did they say about MATLAB?"

# Identifying duplicate chunks in retrieval results
retrieved_documents_matlab = vector_database

.similarity_search(query_matlab, k=5)
```

Future discussions will explore strategies for addressing these failure modes, ensuring the retrieval of both relevant and distinct chunks.

## Conclusion

Embeddings and vector stores offer powerful tools for semantic search within large corpora. By carefully processing text into embeddings and leveraging efficient vector retrieval mechanisms, developers can create sophisticated systems capable of understanding and responding to complex queries. The exploration of failure modes and refinement strategies further enhances the robustness and accuracy of these systems.

8. Create a function named `embed_and_store_documents` that takes a list of document chunks, generates embeddings for each chunk (using placeholders), and stores these embeddings in a `SimpleVectorStore`. The function should then return the initialized `SimpleVectorStore`.

9. Develop a Python function named `vector_store_persistence` that demonstrates how to save and load the state of a `SimpleVectorStore` to and from a file. Implement methods for serialization and deserialization of the vector store's data.

10. Write a Python function named `evaluate_search_accuracy` that takes a list of queries and their expected most similar document chunks.
