# 2.2 LangChain Document Loaders
In the realm of data-driven applications, particularly those involving conversational interfaces and Large Language Models (LLMs), the ability to efficiently load, process, and interact with data from various sources is crucial. LangChain, an open-source framework, plays a pivotal role in this process with its extensive suite of document loaders designed to handle a wide range of data types and sources.

## Understanding Document Loaders

Document loaders are specialized components of LangChain that facilitate the access and conversion of data from diverse formats and sources into a standardized document object. This object typically comprises content and associated metadata, enabling seamless integration and processing within LangChain applications. The versatility of document loaders supports data ingestion from websites, databases, and multimedia sources, handling formats such as PDFs, HTML, and JSON, among others.

LangChain offers over 80 different document loaders, each tailored to specific data sources and formats. This guide will focus on several critical types, providing a foundation for understanding and utilizing this powerful toolset.

**Unstructured Data Loaders**

These loaders are adept at handling data from public sources like YouTube, Twitter, and Hacker News, as well as proprietary sources such as Figma and Notion. They are essential for applications requiring access to a broad spectrum of unstructured data.

**Structured Data Loaders**

For applications involving tabular data with text cells or rows, structured data loaders come into play. They support sources like Airbyte, Stripe, and Airtable, enabling users to perform semantic search and question-answering over structured datasets.

## Practical Guide to Using Document Loaders

### Setup and Configuration

Before interacting with external data, it's important to configure the environment correctly. This includes installing necessary packages and setting up API keys for services like OpenAI. 

```python
# Install necessary packages (Note: These may already be installed in your environment)
# !pip install langchain dotenv

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

# Load environment variables from a .env file
load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

# Set the OpenAI API key from the environment variables
openai_api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```

### Loading PDF Documents

One common source of data is PDF documents. The following example demonstrates how to load a PDF document, specifically a transcript from a lecture seriess.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
import re
from collections import Counter

# Initialize the PDF Loader with the path to the PDF document
pdf_loader = PyPDFLoader("docs/lecture_series/Lecture01.pdf")

# Load the document pages
document_pages = pdf_loader.load()

# Function to clean and tokenize text
def clean_and_tokenize(text):
    # Remove non-alphabetic characters and split text into words
    words = re.findall(r'\b[a-z]+\b', text.lower())
    return words

# Initialize a Counter object to keep track of word frequencies
word_frequencies = Counter()

# Iterate over each page in the document
for page in document_pages:
    # Check if the page is not blank
    if page.page_content.strip():
        # Clean and tokenize the page content
        words = clean_and_tokenize(page.page_content)
        # Update word frequencies
        word_frequencies.update(words)
    else:
        # Handle blank page
        print(f"Blank page found at index {document_pages.index(page)}")

# Example: Print the 10 most common words in the document
print("Most common words in the document:")
for word, freq in word_frequencies.most_common(10):
    print(f"{word}: {freq}")

# Accessing metadata of the first page as an example
first_page_metadata = document_pages[0].metadata
print("\nMetadata of the first page:")
print(first_page_metadata)

# Optional: Save the clean text of the document to a file
with open("cleaned_lecture_series_lecture01.txt", "w") as text_file:
    for page in document_pages:
        if page.page_content.strip():  # Check if the page is not blank
            cleaned_text = ' '.join(clean_and_tokenize(page.page_content))
            text_file.write(cleaned_text + "\n")
```

This example includes the following additional steps:

1. **Text Cleaning and Tokenization**: A function `clean_and_tokenize` is added to remove any non-alphabetic characters and split the text into lowercase words for basic normalization.

2. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the script now counts the frequency of each word across the entire document. This can be useful for understanding the most discussed topics or keywords in the lecture series.

3. **Handling Blank Pages**: It checks for blank pages and prints a message if any are found. This is helpful for debugging issues with document loading or to ensure that all content is being accurately captured.

4. **Saving Cleaned Text**: Optionally, the script can save the cleaned and tokenized text of the document to a file. This could be useful for further analysis or processing, such as feeding the text into a natural language processing pipeline.

This expanded code provides a more comprehensive example of processing PDF documents programmatically, from loading and cleaning the text to basic analysis and handling special cases.

### Transcribing YouTube Videos

Another valuable data source is YouTube videos. The following code block demonstrates how to load audio from a YouTube video, transcribe it using OpenAI's Whisper model, and access the transcription.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader
from langchain.document_loaders.parsers import OpenAIWhisperParser
from langchain.document_loaders.blob_loaders.youtube_audio import YoutubeAudioLoader
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from textblob import TextBlob
import os

# Make sure nltk resources are downloaded (e.g., punkt for sentence tokenization)
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

# Specify the YouTube video URL and the directory to save the audio files
video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example_video_id"
audio_save_directory = "docs/youtube/"

# Ensure the directory exists
os.makedirs(audio_save_directory, exist_ok=True)

# Initialize the Generic Loader with the YouTube Audio Loader and Whisper Parser
youtube_loader = GenericLoader(
    YoutubeAudioLoader([video_url], audio_save_directory),
    OpenAIWhisperParser()
)

# Load the document
youtube_documents = youtube_loader.load()

# Example: Accessing the first part of the transcribed content
transcribed_text = youtube_documents[0].page_content[:500]
print(transcribed_text)

# Break down the transcription into sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(transcribed_text)

# Print the first 5 sentences as an example
print("\nFirst 5 sentences of the transcription:")
for sentence in sentences[:5]:
    print(sentence)

# Perform sentiment analysis on the transcribed content
sentiment = TextBlob(transcribed_text).sentiment
print("\nSentiment Analysis:")
print(f"Polarity: {sentiment.polarity}, Subjectivity: {sentiment.subjectivity}")

# Polarity is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0], where -1 means negative sentiment and 1 means positive sentiment.
# Subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.

# Additional analysis or processing can be done here, such as:
# - Extracting named entities (names, places, etc.)
# - Identifying key phrases or topics
# - Summarizing the content
```

This example demonstrates additional steps that can be performed after transcribing YouTube video content:

1. **Sentence Tokenization**: Breaking down the transcribed text into individual sentences, which could be useful for further detailed analysis or processing.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Using `TextBlob` to perform basic sentiment analysis on the transcribed text. This gives an idea of the overall tone of the video - whether it's more positive, negative, or neutral, and how subjective (opinionated) or objective (factual) the content is.

3. **Placeholder for Further Analysis**: Suggestions for additional analysis include extracting named entities, identifying key phrases or topics, and summarizing the content. These steps would require more sophisticated NLP tools and libraries, which can be integrated based on the specific requirements of the project.

This code offers a foundation for not only transcribing YouTube videos but also for beginning to understand and analyze the content of those transcriptions in a structured and automated way.

### Loading Content from URLs

Web content is an inexhaustible source of data. The following example showcases how to load content from a specific URL, such as an educational article or a company handbook.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.probability import FreqDist
from nltk import download
download('punkt')
download('stopwords')

# Initialize the Web Base Loader with the target URL
web_loader = WebBaseLoader("https://example.com/path/to/document")

# Load the document
web_documents = web_loader.load()

# Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(web_documents[0].page_content, 'html.parser')

# Example: Cleaning the web content by removing script and style elements
for script_or_style in soup(["script", "style"]):
    script_or_style.decompose()

# Get text from the HTML page and replace multiple spaces/newlines with single space
clean_text = ' '.join(soup.stripped_strings)

# Print the first 500 characters of the cleaned web content
print(clean_text[:500])

# Extracting specific information
# Example: Extracting all hyperlinks
links = [(a.text, a['href']) for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]
print("\nExtracted links:")
for text, href in links[:5]:  # Print first 5 links as an example
    print(f"{text}: {href}")

# Example: Extracting headings (h1)
headings = [h1.text for h1 in soup.find_all('h1')]
print("\nHeadings found on the page:")
for heading in headings:
    print(heading)

# Text summarization
# Tokenize sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(clean_text)
# Filter out stopwords
stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
filtered_sentences = [' '.join([word for word in sentence.split() if word.lower() not in stop_words]) for sentence in sentences]

# Frequency distribution of words
word_freq = FreqDist(word.lower() for sentence in filtered_sentences for word in sentence.split())

# Print 5 most common words
print("\nMost common words:")
for word, frequency in word_freq.most_common(5):
    print(f"{word}: {frequency}")

# Summarize: Print the first 5 sentences as a simple summary
print("\nSummary of the content:")
for sentence in sentences[:5]:
    print(sentence)
```

This code example includes:

1. **HTML Content Cleaning**: Using Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content and remove unwanted script and style elements, making the text cleaner for analysis.

2. **Extracting Specific Information**: Demonstrating how to extract and print hyperlinks and headings (e.g., h1 tags) from the web page. This can be adapted to extract other types of information as needed, such as images or specific sections.

3. **Text Summarization Basics**: The code tokenizes the cleaned text into sentences, filters out stopwords to remove common but unimportant words, and calculates the frequency distribution of words. It then prints the most common words and uses the first few sentences to provide a simple summary of the content. For more advanced summarization, additional NLP techniques and models would be needed.

This functionality demonstrates a foundational approach to processing and analyzing web content programmatically, from cleaning and information extraction to basic summarization.

### Interacting with Notion Data

Notion databases provide a structured format for personal and company data. The example below illustrates how to load data from a Notion database exported as Markdown.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import NotionDirectoryLoader
import markdown
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Specify the directory containing the exported Notion data
notion_directory = "docs/Notion_DB"

# Initialize the Notion Directory Loader
notion_loader = NotionDirectoryLoader(notion_directory)

# Load the documents
notion_documents = notion_loader.load()

# Example: Printing the first 200 characters of a Notion document's content
print(notion_documents[0].page_content[:200])

# Accessing the metadata of the Notion document
print(notion_documents[0].metadata)

# Convert Markdown to HTML for easier parsing and extraction
html_content = [markdown.markdown(doc.page_content) for doc in notion_documents]

# Parse HTML to extract structured data (e.g., headings, lists, links)
parsed_data = []
for content in html_content:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')
    # Example: Extracting all headings (h1, h2, etc.)
    headings = [heading.text for heading in soup.find_all(['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6'])]
    # Example: Extracting all links
    links = [(a.text, a['href']) for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]
    parsed_data.append({'headings': headings, 'links': links})

# Organize data into a DataFrame for further analysis
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'metadata': [doc.metadata for doc in notion_documents],
    'parsed_content': parsed_data
})

# Example of filtering: Find documents with specific keywords in metadata
keyword = 'Project'
filtered_docs = df[df['metadata'].apply(lambda x: keyword.lower() in x.get('title', '').lower())]

print("\nDocuments containing the keyword in the title:")
print(filtered_docs)

# Summarizing or generating reports based on the aggregated content
# Example: Counting documents by category (assuming categories are part of metadata)
if 'category' in df['metadata'].iloc[0]:  # Check if category exists in metadata
    category_counts = df['metadata'].apply(lambda x: x['category']).value_counts()
    print("\nDocument counts by category:")
    print(category_counts)

# This is a foundational approach to processing and analyzing Notion exported data.
# It demonstrates how to parse, filter, and summarize the content for insights or reporting.
```

This example includes the following steps:

1. **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: For easier content parsing, the Markdown content of each Notion document is converted to HTML.

2. **Extracting Structured Data**: Using Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract structured data such as headings and links from each document.

3. **Organizing Data with Pandas**: Creating a pandas DataFrame to organize the metadata and parsed content, facilitating further analysis and manipulation.

4. **Filtering and Analyzing Data**: Demonstrating how to filter documents based on specific keywords in their metadata and how to categorize documents by metadata attributes (e.g., category), if available.

5. **Summarizing Data**: Providing examples of how to summarize or generate reports from the data, such as counting documents by category.

This approach offers a comprehensive method for handling and deriving insights from Notion database exports, leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and analysis libraries.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Optimize API Usage**: When working with external APIs, such as OpenAI's Whisper for transcription, monitor usage to avoid unexpected costs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: After loading data, it may require preprocessing (e.g., removing white space, splitting text) to be in a usable format for further analysis or model training.
- **Contribute to Open Source**: If you encounter data sources not supported

 by existing document loaders, consider contributing to the LangChain project by developing new loaders.

## Practice questions:

1. **PDF Document Word Frequency Analysis**: Modify the given PDF document loading and word frequency analysis example to ignore common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "in"). Use the `nltk` library to filter out these stopwords from the analysis. Print the top 5 most common words that are not stopwords.

2. **Transcribing YouTube Video**: Assuming you have a YouTube video URL, write a Python function that takes the URL as an input, uses the OpenAI Whisper model to transcribe the video, and returns the first 100 words of the transcription. Handle any potential errors gracefully.

3. **Loading and Cleaning Web Content**: Given a URL, write a Python script that loads the web page content, removes all HTML tags, and prints the clean text. Use `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing and cleaning.

4. **Notion Data Analysis**: Assuming you have a directory containing Notion data exported as Markdown files, write a Python script that converts all Markdown files to HTML, extracts all links (both the text and the href attribute), and prints them. Use the `markdown` library for conversion and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the HTML.

5. **Sentiment Analysis on Transcribed Content**: Extend the YouTube video transcription example by performing sentiment analysis on the transcribed text using the `TextBlob` library. Print out the overall sentiment score (polarity) and whether the content is mostly positive, negative, or neutral.

6. **Data Frame Manipulation**: Based on the Notion data loading and processing example, write a Python script that creates a pandas DataFrame from the loaded Notion documents, adds a new column indicating the word count of each document's content, and prints the titles of the top 3 longest documents.

7. **Summarize Web Content**: For a given URL, write a Python script that loads the web page, extracts the main content, and generates a simple summary by printing the first and last sentence of the content. Use `BeautifulSoup` for content extraction and `nltk` for sentence tokenization.
