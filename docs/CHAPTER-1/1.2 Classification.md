# 1.2 Classification

## Understanding SYSTEM and USER in AI Conversations

For a classification example, you'd typically want to provide the model with a scenario where it needs to classify a given text into predefined categories. Here's how you could set up `system_message` and `user_message` for such a task:

- **`system_message`**: This part should explain the task at hand, including the categories available for classification. It sets the context for what the AI is expected to do.

- **`user_message`**: This should contain the text that needs to be classified. It's the input based on which the AI will make its classification.

Given this setup, let's create an example where the task is to classify customer feedback into categories such as "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral".

**System Message**
```python
system_message = """Classify the customer feedback into one of the following categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral."""
```

**User Message**
For the user_message, let's create a piece of feedback that needs classification:
```python
user_message = """I recently purchased a product from your store. The shopping experience was fantastic, and the product quality exceeded my expectations!"""
```

### How it works

When interacting with OpenAI's GPT models via the Chat Completion API, messages within the conversation are structured to accurately simulate an exchange between a user and the AI system. Each message is represented as a dictionary with at least two key components: `role` and `content`. The `role` key specifies the originator of the message, while the `content` key contains the actual text of the message. Distinguishing between `{'role': 'system'}` and `{'role': 'user'}` is crucial for designing interactions that elicit the desired response from the AI model.

**`{'role': 'user'}`**

Messages tagged with `{'role': 'user'}` signify that the message is coming from the user's perspective, akin to the user asking a question or making a statement to the AI. These are typically queries, commands, or inputs that the AI is expected to respond to. By marking a message as originating from the user, you're simulating a user's part in the conversation, guiding the AI on how to frame its response.

**`{'role': 'system'}`**

Conversely, messages marked with `{'role': 'system'}` provide instructions, context, or constraints to the AI model, simulating system-generated messages. These can dictate the AI's behavior, personality, or response style, such as instructing the AI to respond in the style of a specific author or adhere to certain guidelines. System messages influence how the AI understands and responds to subsequent user messages.

The sequence of messages between `system` and `user` roles guides the AI model in generating contextually relevant responses, aligned with both direct user inputs and overarching system instructions. This dynamic exchange allows the AI to adapt its responses based on the provided context and instructions, enabling more nuanced and interactive conversations.

**Example**

Consider a scenario where you want the AI to generate a poem about a happy carrot in a whimsical style. The message sequence might look like this:

1. **System Message**: Sets the context or provides instructions.
   - `{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an assistant that responds in the style of a whimsical poet."}`
2. **User Message**: Poses a query or request.
   - `{'role': 'user', 'content': "Write me a very short poem about a happy carrot."}`

This conversation flow allows for crafting nuanced and contextually aware interactions with AI, enabling creative and effective use of language models across various applications.

## Classification Example
Here's how you could assemble the complete example with these messages:

```python
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())  # read local .env file

openai.api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']

def classify(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0, max_tokens=500):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature, 
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

delimiter = "####"
system_message = """Classify the customer feedback into one of the following categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral."""

user_message = """I recently purchased a product from your store. The shopping experience was fantastic, and the product quality exceeded my expectations!"""

messages = [  
    {'role':'system', 'content': system_message},    
    {'role':'user', 'content': f"{delimiter}{user_message}{delimiter}"},  
] 

response = classify(messages)
print(response)
```

### More Classification Examples

Below are 10 examples of prompts designed for classification tasks, covering a variety of topics and categories. Each example includes a brief description of the task and the categories to classify into, followed by a specific `system_message` and a generic `user_message` that would be classified:

**1. Email Classification**

**Categories:** Work, Personal, Spam

- **System Message:** "Classify the following email as Work, Personal, or Spam."
- **User Message:** "Great deals on our latest electronics! Click now to save big."

**2. Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**

**Categories:** Positive, Negative, Neutral

- **System Message:** "Determine if the sentiment of the following movie review is Positive, Negative, or Neutral."
- **User Message:** "The film had stunning visuals, but the storyline was predictable and lacked depth."

**3. News Article Topic Classification**
