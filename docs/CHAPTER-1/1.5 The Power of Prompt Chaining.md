# 1.5 The Power of Prompt Chaining

## Core Concepts

**Understanding Prompt Chaining**

Prompt chaining involves breaking down a complex task into a series of simpler, interconnected prompts, each handling a specific subtask. This method contrasts with single-prompt approaches, which attempt to resolve complex queries in one go. The rationale behind prompt chaining is similar to tackling a multifaceted problem by addressing its components one at a time, thereby simplifying the overall process.

**Analogies for Clarity**

- **Cooking a Meal**: Comparing single-step cooking of a complex dish to preparing it in stages. The latter approach minimizes errors and ensures each component is perfectly cooked.
- **Software Development**: Relating the concept to writing modular code versus dealing with spaghetti code. Modular code simplifies debugging and maintenance by clearly defining dependencies and responsibilities.

## Practical Applications and Benefits

**Workflow Management**

By maintaining the system's state at each step and adapting subsequent actions based on this state, prompt chaining allows for a more structured approach to problem-solving. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the outcome of one subtask determines the direction of the next, such as customer service interactions where queries are classified before specific information is retrieved and presented.

**Cost Efficiency**

Longer prompts consume more computational resources. By using prompt chaining, only the necessary information is processed at each step, potentially reducing the operational costs associated with language model usage.

**Error Reduction**

Focusing on one subtask at a time reduces the likelihood of errors and simplifies the debugging process. It also makes it easier to insert human intervention at specific stages if needed, further enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the workflow.

**Dynamic Information Loading**

Prompt chaining facilitates the selective inclusion of relevant information at different stages, thereby keeping the model's context focused and manageable. This is particularly advantageous given the context limitations of current language models, which restrict the amount of information that can be processed in a single interaction.

## Methodologies

**Step-by-Step Approach**

1. **Initial Task Decomposition**: Break down the complex task into smaller, logically ordered subtasks.
2. **State Management**: Design a system to track the progress and outcomes of each subtask, ensuring smooth transitions between stages.
3. **Prompt Design**: For each subtask, create focused prompts that provide the model with just enough information to proceed without overwhelming it.
4. **Information Retrieval and Processing**: Implement helper functions or use existing tools to fetch and preprocess data as required by the workflow.
5. **Dynamic Context Adjustment**: Adjust the model's context dynamically, based on the outcomes of previous subtasks, to ensure relevance and efficiency in information processing.

**Best Practices**

- **Minimize Complexity**: Use prompt chaining judiciously, avoiding it for tasks simple enough to be handled with a single prompt.
- **Ensure Clarity**: Design each prompt to be as clear and focused as possible, reducing the risk of misinterpretation by the model.
- **Manage Context**: Keep track of the context externally and update the model's context dynamically to prevent information overload.
- **Optimize for Efficiency**: Structure the workflow to minimize computational costs without sacrificing the quality of outcomes.
- **Continuous Testing and Refinement**: Regularly test the entire chain for potential failures and refine prompts based on performance.


## Example

### Setting Up the Environment
Before diving into the code, ensure that your environment is properly set up by installing necessary Python libraries and loading API keys. This setup involves using the `dotenv` library to manage environment variables securely and the `openai` library to interact with OpenAI's GPT models.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

# Load the environment variables from a .env file
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

# Initialize client (reads OPENAI_API_KEY from env)
client = OpenAI()
```

### Extracting Relevant Information from User Queries
The first step in our workflow involves processing user queries to extract relevant product and category information. This process is facilitated by structured system messages that guide the model's response format, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

```python
# Define a function to retrieve model completions based on user and system messages
def retrieve_model_response(message_sequence, model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0, max_tokens=500):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=message_sequence,
        temperature=temperature, 
        max_tokens=max_tokens, 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

# System message defining the task structure and expected response format
system_instruction = """
You will be provided with customer service queries. The query will be delimited with '####'.
Output a Python list of objects, each representing a product or category mentioned in the query.
"""

# Example user query about specific products and categories
user_query = "#### Tell me about the SmartX ProPhone and the FotoSnap DSLR Camera, and about your TVs ####"

# Prepare the message sequence for the model
message_sequence = [  
    {'role':'system', 'content': system_instruction},    
    {'role':'user', 'content': user_query},  
]

# Retrieve and print the model's response
extracted_info = retrieve_model_response(message_sequence)
print(extracted_info)
```

### Retrieving Detailed Product Information
After extracting the necessary information from user queries, the next step involves fetching detailed information about the identified products and categories. This section shows how to structure your product database and query it efficiently.

```python
# Sample product database
product_database = {
    "TechPro Ultrabook": {
        "name": "TechPro Ultrabook",
        "category": "Computers and Laptops",
        # Additional product details...
    },
    # Other products...
}

# Function to get product information by name
def get_product_details_by_name(product_name):
    return product_database.get(product_name, None)

# Function to get all products in a specific category
def get_products_in_category(category_name):
    return [product for product in product_database.values() if product["category"] == category_name]

# Example usage
print(get_product_details_by_name("TechPro Ultrabook"))
print(get_products_in_category("Computers and Laptops"))
```

### Reading and Processing JSON Strings
When working with complex workflows, it's common to pass data in JSON format. The following example demonstrates how to convert a JSON string back into Python objects for further processing.

```python
import json

# Function to convert JSON string to Python list
def json_string_to_python_list(json_string):
    if json_string is None:
        return None
    try:
        # Ensure proper JSON format by replacing single quotes with double quotes
        json_string = json_string.replace("'", "\"")
        return json.loads(json_string)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Error: Invalid JSON string")
        return None

# Example JSON string (replace with actual model output)
json_input = "[{'category': 'Smartphones and Accessories', 'products': ['SmartX ProPhone']}]"

# Convert and print the Python list
python_list = json_string_to_python_list(json_input)
print(python_list)
```

### Generating User Responses Based on Product Information
Finally, after retrieving the necessary product information, it's time to generate a response to the user's query. This process involves formatting the retrieved data into a comprehensive and user-friendly format.

```python
# Function to generate a response string from product data
def generate_response_from_data(product_data_list

):
    response_string = ""
    if product_data_list is None:
        return response_string
    for data in product_data_list:
        # Process each product or category...
        response_string += json.dumps(data, indent=4) + "\n"
    return response_string

# System message for responding to user queries
response_instruction = """
You are a customer service assistant. Respond with concise answers and ask follow-up questions if necessary.
"""

# Generate the response based on product information
final_response = generate_response_from_data(python_list)
print(final_response)
```


### Comprehensive Customer Service Interaction

Alex starts by inquiring about photography products, encounters an issue with a recently purchased product, asks about warranty coverage, and receives recommendations for accessories.

```python
# Define the system instruction for handling customer service queries
system_instruction = """
You will be provided with customer service queries. The query will be delimited with '####'. Output a Python list of objects, each representing a product or category mentioned in the query.
"""

# Alex's initial product inquiry
user_query_1 = "#### I'm interested in upgrading my photography equipment. Can you tell me about the latest DSLR cameras and any compatible accessories? ####"

# Process the initial inquiry
message_sequence_1 = [
    {'role': 'system', 'content': system_instruction},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': user_query_1},
]
response_1 = retrieve_model_response(message_sequence_1)
print("Product Inquiry Response:", response_1)

# Alex encounters an issue with the new camera
troubleshooting_query = "#### I just bought the FotoSnap DSLR Camera you recommended, but I'm having trouble connecting it to my smartphone. What should I do? ####"

# Process the troubleshooting request
system_instruction_troubleshooting = "Provide step-by-step troubleshooting advice for the customer's issue."
message_sequence_2 = [
    {'role': 'system', 'content': system_instruction_troubleshooting},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': troubleshooting_query},
]
response_2 = retrieve_model_response(message_sequence_2)
print("Troubleshooting Response:", response_2)

# Alex asks about the warranty for the new camera
follow_up_query = "#### Also, can you clarify what the warranty covers for the FotoSnap DSLR Camera? ####"

# Process the warranty inquiry
system_instruction_follow_up = "Provide detailed information about the product's warranty coverage."
message_sequence_3 = [
    {'role': 'system', 'content': system_instruction_follow_up},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': follow_up_query},
]
response_3 = retrieve_model_response(message_sequence_3)
print("Warranty Information Response:", response_3)

# The system offers additional assistance based on Alex's interest
additional_assistance_query = "#### Given your interest in photography, would you like recommendations on lenses and tripods compatible with the FotoSnap DSLR Camera? ####"

# Process the additional assistance offer
system_instruction_additional_assistance = "Offer recommendations for accessories that complement the user's existing products."
message_sequence_4 = [
    {'role': 'system', 'content': system_instruction_additional_assistance},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': additional_assistance_query},
]
response_4 = retrieve_model_response(message_sequence_4)
print("Additional Assistance Response:", response_4)
```
